# adjust_brightness
This is a simple script for adjusting screen brightness
on a linux system. Sometimes you just want a quick and
dirty fix for something. 

If you want to run this script without sudo you can change
perms on /sys/.../brightness.

This is set up for my laptop specifically. Before using you
should edit the py file to fit your machine.

This is foss, so of course no warranties or anything like that.
