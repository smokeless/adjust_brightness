This is a simple script for adjusting screen brightness
on a linux system. Sometimes you just want a quick and
dirty fix for something. 

This quick and dirty fix will require you to suid root so that 
you can edit /sys/.../brightness. If you are uncomfortable doing so, 
you can execute it as root, or change permissions on your 
.../brightness file.

This is set up for my laptop specifically. Before using you
should edit the py file to fit your machine.

This is foss, so of course no warranties or anything like that.
